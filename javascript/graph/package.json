The graph should contains an `add node method` (which adds a node to the graph), an `add edge method` (which adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph), a `get nodes method` (which returns all the nodes in the graph as a set), a `get neighbors method` (which returns a collection of edges connected to the given node), a `size method` (which returns the total number of nodes in the graph), a `breadth first traversal method` (which returns a collection of nodes in the order they were visited), a `depth first traversal method` (which returns a collection of nodes in their pre-order depth-first traversal order). Includes extensive test suite.",
